## 🏗️ Agentic Intelligence Architecture

The heart of HireGuard AI is the **Agent Orchestrator**, which manages the following specialized agents:

| Agent | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Resume Intelligence** | Extracts structured data and performs initial fraud analysis on documents. |
| **Employment Verification** | Analyzes career progression and verifies company histories. |
| **Technical Intelligence** | Evaluates skill sets and cross-references GitHub activity for technical depth. |
| **Risk Assessment** | Synthesizes data from all agents to provide a final integrity and risk score. |
